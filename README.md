## Folder Structure
This project design by using clean architecture and hexagonal architecture so folder of project will organize base on 
clean architecture below 

Ref: https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html

Here below is how folder map to layer and component in clean architecture

- domain -> Entity
- usecase -> Usecase 
- repository -> Repository
- api -> Handler
- driver -> remote call
